# Databricks-Challenge
Excited to be joining the Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge by Indian Data Club! I’m looking forward to strengthening my fundamentals in Databricks, Apache Spark, and real‑world data engineering workflows through hands‑on learning. Eager to learn, build, and grow alongside the community over the next 14 days!

# Day 0 | Setup & Data Loading – Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge
Focused on setting up the environment and preparing data before starting Day 1.

What I completed: → Created Databricks Community Edition account and cluster → Configured Kaggle API credentials → Created schema and volume for data storage → Downloaded and extracted e‑commerce dataset from Kaggle → Loaded October & November 2019 data into Spark

Setup done. Data ready.

What I Learned Today:
• Apache Spark architecture (Driver, Executors, DAG) • Difference between DataFrames and RDDs • Concept of lazy evaluation in Spark • Usage of notebook magic commands (%sql, %python, %fs)

Tasks I Completed:
• Uploaded a sample e‑commerce CSV file • Read data into Spark DataFrames • Performed basic operations like select, filter, groupBy, and orderBy • Exported processed results
