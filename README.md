# Databricks-Challenge
Excited to be joining the Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge by Indian Data Club! I’m looking forward to strengthening my fundamentals in Databricks, Apache Spark, and real‑world data engineering workflows through hands‑on learning. Eager to learn, build, and grow alongside the community over the next 14 days.

# Day 0 | Setup & Data Loading – Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge
Focused on setting up the environment and preparing data before starting Day 1.

What I completed: → Created Databricks Community Edition account and cluster → Configured Kaggle API credentials → Created schema and volume for data storage → Downloaded and extracted e‑commerce dataset from Kaggle → Loaded October & November 2019 data into Spark

Setup done. Data ready.

# DAY 04 Completed (12/01/2026) – Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge

I’ve completed Day 4 of the Databricks AI Challenge, focusing on Delta Lake fundamentals and reliability in data engineering.

What I Learned Today:
• Understanding Delta Lake architecture and how it extends Parquet
• How ACID transactions ensure data consistency in distributed systems
• Schema enforcement vs schema evolution in Delta tables
• Key differences between Delta Lake and Parquet for analytics workloads

Tasks I Completed:
• Converted raw CSV data into Delta format
• Created managed Delta tables using SQL and PySpark
• Tested schema enforcement by attempting invalid writes
